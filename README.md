*Social Network for Music Fans is a web-based application that allows users to review and rate music and interact with other users via social networks.*
<br /><br />

In this system, there are two types of users: registered users and visitors. Most of the features are geared toward registered users.

Registered users can search and browse for music, listen to music, rate music on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, and write music reviews. They can also interact via social networks. Registered users can also "friend" and "follow" other users. Two users become friends when they both agree to the friendship; one person requests to be friends, and the other can choose to accept or decline. A registered user can also follow another user, enabling them to receive automatic updates on certain content generated by the followed user. 
  
Visitors, on the other hand, can search, browse, and listen to music, but they cannot access the other features.

All the data related to registered users, ratings, reviews, and music is stored in a relational database.
